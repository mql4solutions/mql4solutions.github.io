id="service"> <h2 class="page-section__h"> Service </h2> <div class="page-section__body2"> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can you modify or fix my own code? </h3> <p> No &mdash; MQL4Solutions does not do ad hoc patchwork of outside code, nor do we take up the care and maintenance of any code that has been authored or modified outside MQL4Solutions engineering. We follow a strict software engineering process that goes as follows: First, we take your trading steps written in English and document Specifications in English. Then we automate against these Specifications using in-house engineering and ensure that the automation behaves as specified. Then we support our clients, continuing to use our in-house engineering that we know is built with strong foundations, so that we can concentrate on supporting high level evolving automation needs far into the future on cleanly layered and extensible engineering foundations. Therefore, MQL4Solutions does not have a service offering for ad hoc patchwork of outside code. </p> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can I add to the Specifications after the Gig has started? </h3> <p2> Once a Gig starts, we're already in Development. Therefore, new requirements dropped on us midway through Development are an enhancement request for the next version. <p></p> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> How many free revisions can I have? </h3> <p> MQL4Solutions does not do free revisions or free labor. New requests and requirements are an enhancement request that we'll quote with a Gig and delivery time for the new work involved. Evolving requirements are an ongoing part of normal trading and normal life, it's not free. </p> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can you make a robot that trades exactly like this one? </h3> <p> No, we don't know how that robot works &mdash; ask the vendor you got it from. </p> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> I use my vision and feelings in some parts of trading. Can you help to quantify and automate? </h3> <p> Sometimes &mdash; it depends. Every client is different. If we assess that you intend to pay for and accept outcomes for work, labor and time to produce something that you don't even know yourself what it is exactly, and you are the type who will pay for continued human hours to develop against vague guesses of what you want, then we might be of service. This is very rare and most of the time, no. We need Specs that are usable as a <em>contract of correct output</em>. </p> </p2></div> </article> <div class="page-section-spacer"></div> <article class="page-section in-contents" id="technical"> <h2 class="page-section__h"> Technical </h2> <div class="page-section__body2"> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can I have a custom sound wav input for the alert? </h3> <p> This won't work most of the time, because an MT4 alert <em>popup</em> will trigger the global <q>Alert</q> sound configured under <em>Options &ndash; Events &ndash; Alert</em>. Global sounds override any other sound. There's not much point. </p> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can you develop a multi-symbol Indicator? </h3> <p> Yes, but you will suffer certain constraints and shortcomings as opposed to making it an <em>Expert Advisor</em> (even if all you're doing is getting an alert). You must accept these consequences: </p> <p> MT4 <em>Indicators</em> make a new calculation only when a tick on the current chart arrives. But all the symbols involved are having quote updates at different rates, some slower and some faster, than the chart you've attached the indicator on. So, if you are attached on EURUSD and the EURUSD price isn't changing, but the indicator is supposed to do something for GBPUSD because GBPUSD prices just changed, well the Indicator won't see it, because the indicator didn't make a processing cycle yet. Later when the EURUSD price makes a tick, then this will trigger the indicator to make a new calculation, and only now it will sample what's going on with GBPUSD. So, you're not really watching GBPUSD or 40 other symbols at a reliable frequency this way. </p> <p> Also, all running MT4 <em>Indicators</em> run inside a <strong>single global processing queue (thread) in MT4</strong>. This queue is the same queue for other tasks of the MT4 Terminal, such as Market Watch, events, dragging, just everything. What this means is that if any running Indicator is taking lots of time, everything else is frozen and waiting for it. This is why bulky indicators, or indicators that are too slow, freeze up the whole MT4 terminal. Now if you want to do complex things on 40 symbols every time the price ticks, you're going to get a lot of micro-freezes in the terminal and freeze up any other running things that might be real-time critical. You can't even properly use your mouse to close an order if the Terminal is frozen waiting for an Indicator. </p> <p> MT4 <em>Indicators</em> should ideally only be used for calculating things on the attached chart symbol, and they should not be bulky. </p> <p> MT4 <em>Expert Advisors</em>, on the other hand, are each run inside a <strong>separate processing queue (thread)</strong> and therefore each EA does not hold up anything else &mdash; EAs process in <strong>parallel</strong>. Also, MT4 <em>Expert Advisors</em> can make processing cycles based on a <strong>high frequency timer</strong>, so that all symbols' prices can be regularly sampled at a neutrally fair time, like every second, whether or not there is activity on just the chart you have attached it to. While working on complex tasks on 40+ symbols, the EA won't freeze up the Terminal. </p> <p> For this reason, we recommend that any multi-symbol system should actually be made as an Expert Advisor for any real trader wanting real-time critical reliability. </p> <div class="mdc-card mt-2 info-bg-clr info-clr info-brdr-thickleft"> <div class="card-freeform-text-content"> <p> There are lots of technical things to know if you want a stable, mission-critical system. We'll give you a heads-up on a need-to-know basis. </p> </div> </div> </div> </article> <div class="page-section-spacer"></div> <article class="page-section in-contents" id="privacy"> <h2 class="page-section__h"> Privacy and Copyright </h2> <div class="page-section__body2"> <h3 class="page-section__h2"> Can you sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)? </h3> <p> No. MQL4Solutions takes legal contracts very seriously &mdash; we don't hand out signatures on random request. We will not sign an NDA if we believe the customer will speak any word or write any small point that is non-unique, resulting in the contract restricting us from operating our business normally on topics that are widely discussed. Software authorship and copyright are complex topics; for example, <em>J. Welles Wilder Jr.</em> is the father of the <em>RSI</em> technical indicator mathematical formula, but the inbuilt MT4 RSI indicator is a materialization of RSI in software authored by <em>MetaQuotes</em> and therefore this particular piece of code belongs to <em>MetaQuotes</em>. A system powered by an MQL4Solutions engine contains code infrastructure for reliable execution that is not the intellectual property of the customer and cannot be claimed as such. We do not recommend going into a legal discussion.
