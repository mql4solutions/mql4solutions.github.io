      Point vs Pip

        <p>
            A <strong>Point</strong> is the smallest price change for a particular chart given by your particular broker.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, 1 <strong>Point</strong> on EURUSD is 0.00001 if your broker provides 5 digits for EURUSD.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your broker provides EURUSD with 4 digits, then 1 <strong>Point</strong> on EURUSD is 0.0001.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should always use units of <strong>Points</strong> in defining your robot, because it's the smallest unit and
            therefore gives you
            the most flexibility. The meaning of <strong>Point</strong> is understood on any chart and any broker. Just look at how many
            digits a chart has, and that's what your robot will use as a <strong>Point</strong> in its algorithm.

                    A <strong>Pip</strong>, to us, is a financial convention used in News and is a bit vague for development. In News and finance,
                    when a person speaks of a <q>pip</q> on EURUSD, they will probably be referring to a price movement of 0.0001.

                    But in creating a robot with inputs,
                    you want to give it maximum flexibility by defining its units in <strong>Points</strong>, which specifically means
                    in MT4 to be
                    <strong>the smallest given price unit for that chart and that broker you're currently running the robot on</strong>.
